# HMCTS Express Monorepo Template

Production-ready Node.js starter with cloud-native capabilities for building HMCTS digital services using Express.js, TypeScript and GOV.UK Design System.

## 🚀 Overview

This template provides everything you need to create accessible, secure, and scalable applications that meet GDS and HMCTS standards.

## 📋 Using This Template

This monorepo will contain all your apps, libraries, and infrastructure for your HMCTS service.

### Naming Convention

- **Team name**: Your HMCTS service (e.g., CaTH, Divorce, Civil)
- **Product name**: The specific product/service (e.g., Possessions, Money-Claims)
- If the product encompasses the whole service, use "Service"

**Examples:**
- Team: CaTH, Product: Service → `cath-service`
- Team: Civil, Product: Money-Claims → `civil-money-claims`

### Setup Steps

1. **Run the initialization script**:
```bash
./.github/scripts/init.sh
```

The script will:
- Prompt for your team name (e.g., `CaTH`)
- Prompt for your product name (e.g., `Service`)
- Replace all template values throughout the codebase
- Rebuild the yarn lockfile
- Run tests to verify everything works
- Remove itself after completion

3. **Review and commit**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize from template"
git push
```

## ✨ Key Features

### Cloud Native Platform
- **Health Checks**: Configurable health endpoints with readiness and liveness probes for Kubernetes deployments
- **Properties Volume**: Secure configuration management through mounted volumes with automatic environment variable injection
- **Azure Integration**: Built-in support for Azure Key Vault secrets management and properties volume mounting
- **Application Insights**: Comprehensive monitoring with Azure Application Insights including custom metrics and distributed tracing

### Express GOV.UK Starter for frontends
- **GOV.UK Design System**: Fully integrated GOV.UK Frontend with Nunjucks templates and automatic asset compilation

- **Dynamic Parameters**: Support for dynamic route segments using `[param]` syntax (e.g., `/users/[id]`)
- **HTTP Method Exports**: Export handlers for any HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- **Middleware Support**: Single handlers or arrays of middleware for complex request pipelines
- **Multiple Mount Points**: Mount different directories with different URL prefixes
- **Zero Dependencies**: Lightweight implementation with no external dependencies

### Monorepo Architecture
- Single repository for multiple applications (e.g. multiple frontends sharing common code, APIs or libraries)
- Workspace-based structure with Yarn workspaces
- Shared libraries for common functionality
- Testing with Vitest and Playwright
- Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Biome for fast linting and formatting

```

### Creating a New Feature Module

1. **Create module structure**:
```bash
mkdir -p libs/my-feature/src/pages      # Page controllers and templates
mkdir -p libs/my-feature/src/locales    # Translation files (optional)
mkdir -p libs/my-feature/src/assets/css # Module styles (optional)
mkdir -p libs/my-feature/src/assets/js  # Module scripts (optional)
cd libs/my-feature
```

2. **Initialize package.json**:
```json
{
  "name": "@hmcts/my-feature",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "production": "./dist/index.js",
      "default": "./src/index.ts"
    },
    "./config": {
      "production": "./dist/config.js",
      "default": "./src/config.ts"
    }
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc && yarn build:nunjucks",
    "build:nunjucks": "mkdir -p dist/pages && cd src/pages && find . -name '*.njk' -exec sh -c 'mkdir -p ../../dist/pages/$(dirname {}) && cp {} ../../dist/pages/{}' \\;",
    "dev": "tsc --watch",
    "test": "vitest run",
    "test:watch": "vitest watch",
    "format": "biome format --write .",
    "lint": "biome check .",
    "lint:fix": "biome check --write ."
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "express": "^5.1.0"
  }
}
```
**Note**: The `build:nunjucks` script is required if your module contains Nunjucks templates.

3. **Create tsconfig.json**:
```json
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["**/*.test.ts", "**/*.spec.ts", "dist", "node_modules", "src/assets/"]
}
```

4. **Register module in root tsconfig.json**:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      // ... existing paths ...
      "@hmcts/my-feature": ["libs/my-feature/src"]
    }
  }
}
```

5. **Create src/config.ts for module configuration**:
```typescript
import path from "node:path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

// Module configuration for app registration
export const pageRoutes = { path: path.join(__dirname, "pages") };
export const apiRoutes = { path: path.join(__dirname, "routes") };
export const prismaSchemas = path.join(__dirname, "../prisma");
export const assets = path.join(__dirname, "assets/");
```

**Create src/index.ts for business logic exports**:
```typescript
// Business logic exports only
export * from "./my-feature/service.js";
export * from "./my-feature/validation.js";
```

**IMPORTANT**: Config exports (pageRoutes, apiRoutes, prismaSchemas, assets) must be in a separate `config.ts` file to avoid circular dependencies during Prisma client generation. Apps import config using the `/config` path (e.g., `@hmcts/my-feature/config`).

6. **Register module in applications**:

```typescript
// apps/web/src/app.ts
import { pageRoutes as myFeaturePages } from "@hmcts/my-feature/config";

app.use(await createGovukFrontend(app, [myFeaturePages.path], { /* options */ }));
app.use(await createSimpleRouter(myFeaturePages));

// apps/web/vite.config.ts
import { assets as myFeatureAssets } from "@hmcts/my-feature/config";
const baseConfig = createBaseViteConfig([
  path.join(__dirname, "src"),
  myFeatureAssets
]);

// apps/api/src/app.ts
import { apiRoutes as myFeatureRoutes } from "@hmcts/my-feature/config";
app.use(await createSimpleRouter(myFeatureRoutes));

// libs/postgres-prisma/src/schema-discovery.ts
import { prismaSchemas as myFeatureSchemas } from "@hmcts/my-feature/config";
const schemaPaths = [myFeatureSchemas, /* other schemas */];
```

   - **Add dependency** to relevant app package.json files: `"@hmcts/my-feature": "workspace:*"`

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

| Type | Tool | Location | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| **Unit Tests** | Vitest | Co-located `*.test.ts` | Business logic validation |
| **E2E Tests** | Playwright | `e2e-tests/` | User journey validation |
| **Accessibility Tests** | Axe-core + Playwright | `e2e-tests/` | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance |

```bash
# Run specific test suites
yarn test                   # Unit tests
yarn test:e2e               # E2E tests
yarn test:coverage          # Coverage report
```

## Security

The GitHub Action pipelines contain a number of security checks, including:

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automatically scans for vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **SonarQube**: SAST analysis for code quality and security

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Running the application requires the following tools to be installed in your environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12.0.0 or later
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

### Running the application

Install dependencies by executing the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

Bundle:

```bash
yarn webpack
```

Run:

```bash
yarn start
```

The applications's home page will be available at http://localhost:3040

### Running with Docker

Create docker image:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

Run the application by executing the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start the frontend container exposing the application's port
(set to `3040` in this template app).

In order to test if the application is up, you can visit https://localhost:3040 in your browser.
You should get a very basic home page (no styles, etc.).

## Developing

### Code style

We use [ESLint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint)
alongside [sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint)

Running the linting with auto fix:

```bash
yarn lint --fix
```

### Running the tests

This template app uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io//) as the test engine. You can run unit tests by executing
the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

Here's how to run functional tests (the template contains just one sample test):

```bash
yarn test:routes
```

Running accessibility tests:

```bash
yarn test:a11y
```

Make sure all the paths in your application are covered by accessibility tests (see [a11y.ts](src/test/a11y/a11y.ts)).

### Security

#### CSRF prevention

[Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://github.com/pillarjs/understanding-csrf) prevention has already been
set up in this template, at the application level. However, you need to make sure that CSRF token
is present in every HTML form that requires it. For that purpose you can use the `csrfProtection` macro,
included in this template app. Your njk file would look like this:

```
{% from "macros/csrf.njk" import csrfProtection %}
...
<form ...>
  ...
    {{ csrfProtection(csrfToken) }}
  ...
</form>
...
```

#### Helmet

This application uses [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/), which adds various security-related HTTP headers
to the responses. Apart from default Helmet functions, following headers are set:

- [Referrer-Policy](https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/referrer-policy/)
- [Content-Security-Policy](https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/csp/)

There is a configuration section related with those headers, where you can specify:

- `referrerPolicy` - value of the `Referrer-Policy` header

Here's an example setup:

```json
    "security": {
      "referrerPolicy": "origin",
    }
```

Make sure you have those values set correctly for your application.

### Healthcheck

The application exposes a health endpoint (https://localhost:3040/health), created with the use of
[Nodejs Healthcheck](https://github.com/hmcts/nodejs-healthcheck) library. This endpoint is defined
in [health.ts](src/main/routes/health.ts) file. Make sure you adjust it correctly in your application.
In particular, remember to replace the sample check with checks specific to your frontend app,
e.g. the ones verifying the state of each service it depends on.
